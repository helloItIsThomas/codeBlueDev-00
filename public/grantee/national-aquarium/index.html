The mission of the National Aquarium is to inspire conservation of the world’s aquatic treasures by changing the way people care for our blue planet. The National Aquarium is committed to the “triple bottom line,” a phrase describing initiatives that benefit people, the planet and the economy.

They do this by advocating for responsible aquaculture, protecting ecosystems, rescuing and rehabilitating marine animals and implementing sustainable business practices.

As a member of the Conservation Committee, Code Blue is working towards creating a wild sanctuary for dolphins freed from captivity.
