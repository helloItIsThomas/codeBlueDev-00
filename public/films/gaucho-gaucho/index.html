Gaucho Gaucho
<br>
The documentary film GAUCHO GAUCHO introduces the world to a group of legendary gauchos (or South American cowboys) who live apart from modern society. The film weaves together tales of gauchos confronting the fragility of their existence in the face of unprecedented change. The stories follow men and women of different ages, backgrounds and talents who are all united by their fight to remain free. Gauchos are a community suspended in time. Their handmade clothing: woolen ponchos, bombacha trousers and boina hats are signs to the outside world that they will remain unshackled by rules of the modern world. Their connection to the land is something we must all learn from if we hope to survive on this planet.
