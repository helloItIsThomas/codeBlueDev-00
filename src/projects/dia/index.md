title: "DIA"
description: "I designed a new, fictional identity for the Detroit Institute of Arts with Elizabeth Dezeery and Sean-Marie Rhys Patton. The refreshed identity consists of a redesigned concept and essence statement, color palette, wordmark, typeface pairing and treatment, grid, image treatment, pattern and shape, set of various system applications, and custom mapping + discovery software."

    - src: "The historic Detroit Institute of Arts is one of the central jewels of Detroit. The museum has earned both local and nationwide respect for its collection of pieces that represent a full spectrum of art across many cultures, times, and places."
    - src: "Seeing the DIA as a neutral container clarified the purpose of updating the identity. By keeping our identity minimal and functional, it can allow the art, people, connections, and experiences to blossom."
    - src: "The golden ratio became the foundation of our grid for its deep roots in art history, and its similarity to the winding hallways of the DIA. The lines that we sourced from it each represent a possible path of exploration."
