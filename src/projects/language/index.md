title: "Language is Survival"
description: "I researched, designed, and built an interactive installation to ampilify the voices of Anishinaabe folks, who historically occupied the land of and around Detroit before it was taken from them in 1807."

    - src: "The Anishinaabemowin language is slowly dying, and with it many essential elements of the Anishinaabe culture. Anishinaabemowin is primarily a spoken language and not a written one, therefore Anishinaabemowin language speakers are becoming increasingly rare."
    - src: "Research, interviews with Anishinaabe folks, and brainstorming brought us to the idea of shapeshifting as a metaphor for the switching between cultures and transitioning between languages. Shapeshifting also reinforces the idea that identity is a gradient, not a solid line."
    - src: "Language is Survival is an interactive pathway for exploring and translating the Anishinaabemowin language through classic and contemporary Native stories. Through this process, we are encouraged to learn and speak the Anishinaabemowin language into the world."
