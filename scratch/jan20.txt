today I would like to:
review how to add pages both statically and dynamically.
Static being pages that aren't generated.

Let's start with the Conservation Grantees page.
It is static, so there is only one.
It has templated content though.
It has n number of instances of the conservation grantees layout.

So, i want to see how to add multiple instances of the same layout.
let's verify i have this layout first.
well first lets make sure this new page goes through my base template.
