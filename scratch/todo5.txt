NOT CURRENTLY RESPONSIVE:
- Header Hero text
- Featured Media Partner section on Impact Media page
       should be 2/2 instead of 7/3
- page margins
- footer links (they wrap and should not)
- Film Page margin between the two columns (description and metadata)
- buttons should only wrap on word, not in the middle of a word.
- Purpose Statement needs to always stay within 100vh and 100vw no matter what.
- Set a max width for the Mission Section so that the max word count is never too long.

IF THE FONT SCALING DOESNT WORK
   It is probably smart to make a size in between desktop and mobile.
   It should look good on desktops but just be a little more forgiving.

SITE
• Mobile
   • update film page background image so its the right crop and size and stuff.
• Make sure the hero gradient does not fuck up on resizing or elsewhere.
• Fix shitty text collapsing thing AFTER all other mobile stuff is done.
   Including supporting page resizing.

CURSOR STUFF – 3/4 pm
The cursor dots are too big, make them literally a spec.
Slow them down.
Make them last much shorter.
Make sure they wrap, not leave the scene.
Make it so that it doesnt happen on the landing module, all other things.
