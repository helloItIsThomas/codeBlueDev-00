I want to calculate the drawn height of the image being used as the background for bodyGradient,
then the height of the viewport,
then find the difference,
and set the bottom of the gradient to viewport.height - difference.




WEDNESDAY

• set proper height for the gradient at the bottom of the film header image

4:30pm - 5:00pm
• turn the page loading screen back on
• merge to main
• Re-implement smooth scroll.

POST WEDNESDAY

• Mobile

• Add awards to all films.

• Finish uploading Featured Media Partner content

• update the arrows on the Featured Media Partner section

POST FRIDAY

• Make the desired film link (the one from the embed code) easier to get (aka not pull out the line from the iframe code).

• Make sure all images crop correctly (aka there are no aspect ratio issues with oddly shaped images)

• Try to get the slug to auto-generate and remove it from the UI.

• Put required on the necessary fields.
